# Image Generator

A PHP script to generate an image and save it to the disk.

This PHP script lets you generate an image from scratch or modify an existing image.

## Understanding the Project Structure.

This is a sample script which will generate the image output.png (included in the project) when executed.

* The script is stored in the file named script.php.
* The output image will be saved to disk as an image file name output.png (A sample has already been generated by running the script.php)
* image1.png and image2.png are the two image files used for in this example.
* font.otf is the font used in the final generated image.

Feel free to use this code for anything cool!
